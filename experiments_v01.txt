Quickly review EchoClientServer Client code.

1. Basic client-server operation

- start EchoClientServer server
- start client multiple times showing different ephemeral ports.

2. Show effect of SO_REUSEADDR in setsockopt

- set SO_REUSEADDR to be 0
- start server in one window
- start client in another window
- do some tx and rx
- Cntl-C twice on server window to kill the client socket on server side and the server listening socket
-start server again

- set SO_REUSEADDR to be 1
- repeat the above process


3. Show effect of SO_REUSEADDR in setsockopt

- set SO_REUSEADDR to be 0
- set server HOSTNAME as 0.0.0.0
- start server in one window
- change server HOSTNAME into en0 IP
- start server in another window

- set SO_REUSEADDR to be 1
- set server HOSTNAME as 0.0.0.0
- start server in one window
- change server HOSTNAME into en0 IP
- start server in another window


4. show EchoClientServerClientBind.py client bind section.

- start EchoClientServerClientBind.py -r client and show that we are
  always connecting from port 40000.

- comment in the server section:
  self.socket.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)
  or change the line to self.socket.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 0)
- start the server
- connect a client 
- kill the server 
- start the server again 

- comment in the client section:
  self.socket.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)
  or change the line to self.socket.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 0)
- start the server
- connect a client 
- kill the client 
- reconnect the client 


5. show EchoClientServerIPv6.py code changes to client and server.

- HOSTNAME = "::" 
- Start server, start client.

- start server, HOSTNAME = "::"
- connect to IPv6 server with IPv4 client. What happens?


6. EchoClientServer -r server

- What happens if I paste some greek characters?

- Switch to EchoClientServerAscii.py and do the same thing.

7. use EchoClientServerOneRecv.py
   (default Rx buffer is 1024)

- Interact with server

- Make the buffer small and show what a mess it is.

8. EchoClientServerMultiRecvB.py
   (print for each recv)

- show what happens as the recv buffer size is changed.

- paste in some greek chars. why is this happening?
